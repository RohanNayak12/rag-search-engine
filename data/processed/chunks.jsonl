Numerous\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht\u22121 and the input for position t. This inherently\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\n2 Background\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet.

This makes\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\ndescribed in section 3.2.\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\n3 Model Architecture\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\n2"}

Each layer has two\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6identical layers. In addition to the two\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\n3.2 Attention\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\n3"}

The input consists of\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\nquery with all keys, divide each by \u221adk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\nvalues.\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\nthe matrix of outputs as:\nAttention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKT\n\u221adk\n)V (1)\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\nof 1\u221adk\n. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\nmatrix multiplication code.\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1\u221adk\n.\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively.

For each of these we use\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\n\u2022 In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\n[38, 2, 9].\n\u2022 The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\nencoder.\n\u2022 Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to \u2212\u221e) all values in the input\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\nconnected feed-forward network,"}

This\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\ndff = 2048.\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by \u221admodel.\n5"}

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\nlearned and fixed [9].\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\nP E(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel )\nP E(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel )\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2\u03c0 to 10000 \u00b7 2\u03c0. We\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, P Epos+k can be represented as a linear function of\nP Epos.\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)).

We chose the sinusoidal version\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\nduring training.\n4 Why Self-Attention\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi \u2208 Rd, such as a hidden\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\nconsider three desiderata.\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\ndifferent layer types.\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\n6"}

To improve computational performance for tasks involving\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < ndoes not connect all pairs of input and output\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [ 18], increasing the length of the longest paths\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\nconsiderably, to O(k \u00b7 n \u00b7 d + n \u00b7 d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\nthe approach we take in our model.\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models.

Not only do individual attention\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\n5 Training\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\nsentence pairs.

Unlike recent language repre-\nsentation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Rad-\nford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-\ntrain deep bidirectional representations from\nunlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both\nleft and right context in all layers. As a re-\nsult, the pre-trained BERT model can be \ufb01ne-\ntuned with just one additional output layer\nto create state-of-the-art models for a wide\nrange of tasks, such as question answering and\nlanguage inference, without substantial task-\nspeci\ufb01c architecture modi\ufb01cations.\nBERT is conceptually simple and empirically\npowerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art re-\nsults on eleven natural language processing\ntasks, including pushing the GLUE score to\n80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement),\nMultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute\nimprovement), SQuAD v1.1 question answer-\ning Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute im-\nprovement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1\n(5.1 point absolute improvement).\n1 Introduction\nLanguage model pre-training has been shown to\nbe effective for improving many natural language\nprocessing tasks (Dai and Le, 2015; Peters et al.,\n2018a; Radford et al., 2018; Howard and Ruder,\n2018). These include sentence-level tasks such as\nnatural language inference (Bowman et al., 2015;\nWilliams et al., 2018) and paraphrasing (Dolan\nand Brockett, 2005), which aim to predict the re-\nlationships between sentences by analyzing them\nholistically, as well as token-level tasks such as\nnamed entity recognition and question answering,\nwhere models are required to produce \ufb01ne-grained\noutput at the token level (Tjong Kim Sang and"}

The\nfeature-based approach, such as ELMo (Peters\net al., 2018a), uses task-speci\ufb01c architectures that\ninclude the pre-trained representations as addi-\ntional features. The \ufb01ne-tuning approach, such as\nthe Generative Pre-trained Transformer (OpenAI\nGPT) (Radford et al., 2018), introduces minimal\ntask-speci\ufb01c parameters, and is trained on the\ndownstream tasks by simply \ufb01ne-tuning all pre-\ntrained parameters. The two approaches share the\nsame objective function during pre-training, where\nthey use unidirectional language models to learn\ngeneral language representations.\nWe argue that current techniques restrict the\npower of the pre-trained representations, espe-\ncially for the \ufb01ne-tuning approaches. The ma-\njor limitation is that standard language models are\nunidirectional, and this limits the choice of archi-\ntectures that can be used during pre-training. For\nexample, in OpenAI GPT, the authors use a left-to-\nright architecture, where every token can only at-\ntend to previous tokens in the self-attention layers\nof the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017).

To pre-\ntrain word embedding vectors, left-to-right lan-\nguage modeling objectives have been used (Mnih\nand Hinton, 2009), as well as objectives to dis-\ncriminate correct from incorrect words in left and\nright context (Mikolov et al., 2013).\nThese approaches have been generalized to\ncoarser granularities, such as sentence embed-\ndings (Kiros et al., 2015; Logeswaran and Lee,\n2018) or paragraph embeddings (Le and Mikolov,\n2014). To train sentence representations, prior\nwork has used objectives to rank candidate next\nsentences (Jernite et al., 2017; Logeswaran and\nLee, 2018), left-to-right generation of next sen-\ntence words given a representation of the previous\nsentence (Kiros et al., 2015), or denoising auto-\nencoder derived objectives (Hill et al., 2016).\nELMo and its predecessor (Peters et al., 2017,\n2018a) generalize traditional word embedding re-\nsearch along a different dimension. They extract\ncontext-sensitive features from a left-to-right and a\nright-to-left language model. The contextual rep-\nresentation of each token is the concatenation of\nthe left-to-right and right-to-left representations.\nWhen integrating contextual word embeddings\nwith existing task-speci\ufb01c architectures, ELMo\nadvances the state of the art for several major NLP\nbenchmarks (Peters et al., 2018a) including ques-\ntion answering (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), sentiment\nanalysis (Socher et al., 2013), and named entity\nrecognition (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder,\n2003).

A \u201csequence\u201d refers to the in-\nput token sequence to BERT, which may be a sin-\ngle sentence or two sentences packed together.\nWe use WordPiece embeddings (Wu et al.,\n2016) with a 30,000 token vocabulary. The \ufb01rst\ntoken of every sequence is always a special clas-\nsi\ufb01cation token ( [CLS]). The \ufb01nal hidden state\ncorresponding to this token is used as the ag-\ngregate sequence representation for classi\ufb01cation\ntasks. Sentence pairs are packed together into a\nsingle sequence. We differentiate the sentences in\ntwo ways. First, we separate them with a special\ntoken ([SEP]). Second, we add a learned embed-\nding to every token indicating whether it belongs\nto sentence A or sentence B.

Unfortunately,\nstandard conditional language models can only be\ntrained left-to-right or right-to-left, since bidirec-\ntional conditioning would allow each word to in-\ndirectly \u201csee itself\u201d, and the model could trivially\npredict the target word in a multi-layered context.\nformer is often referred to as a \u201cTransformer encoder\u201d while\nthe left-context-only version is referred to as a \u201cTransformer\ndecoder\u201d since it can be used for text generation.\nIn order to train a deep bidirectional representa-\ntion, we simply mask some percentage of the input\ntokens at random, and then predict those masked\ntokens. We refer to this procedure as a \u201cmasked\nLM\u201d (MLM), although it is often referred to as a\nCloze task in the literature (Taylor, 1953).

In contrast to\ndenoising auto-encoders (Vincent et al., 2008), we\nonly predict the masked words rather than recon-\nstructing the entire input.\nAlthough this allows us to obtain a bidirec-\ntional pre-trained model, a downside is that we\nare creating a mismatch between pre-training and\n\ufb01ne-tuning, since the [MASK] token does not ap-\npear during \ufb01ne-tuning.

In Table 5, we show that removing NSP\nhurts performance signi\ufb01cantly on QNLI, MNLI,\nand SQuAD 1.1. Next, we evaluate the impact\nof training bidirectional representations by com-\nparing \u201cNo NSP\u201d to \u201cLTR & No NSP\u201d. The LTR\nmodel performs worse than the MLM model on all\ntasks, with large drops on MRPC and SQuAD.\nFor SQuAD it is intuitively clear that a LTR\nmodel will perform poorly at token predictions,\nsince the token-level hidden states have no right-\nside context. In order to make a good faith at-\ntempt at strengthening the LTR system, we added\na randomly initialized BiLSTM on top. This does\nsigni\ufb01cantly improve results on SQuAD, but the\nresults are still far worse than those of the pre-\ntrained bidirectional models. The BiLSTM hurts\nperformance on the GLUE tasks.\nWe recognize that it would also be possible to\ntrain separate LTR and RTL models and represent\neach token as the concatenation of the two mod-\nels, as ELMo does. However: (a) this is twice as\nexpensive as a single bidirectional model; (b) this\nis non-intuitive for tasks like QA, since the RTL\nmodel would not be able to condition the answer\non the question; (c) this it is strictly less powerful\nthan a deep bidirectional model, since it can use\nboth left and right context at every layer.\n5.2 Effect of Model Size\nIn this section, we explore the effect of model size\non \ufb01ne-tuning task accuracy.

In this table, we report the average Dev\nSet accuracy from 5 random restarts of \ufb01ne-tuning.\nWe can see that larger models lead to a strict ac-\ncuracy improvement across all four datasets, even\nfor MRPC which only has 3,600 labeled train-\ning examples, and is substantially different from\nthe pre-training tasks. It is also perhaps surpris-\ning that we are able to achieve such signi\ufb01cant\nimprovements on top of models which are al-\nready quite large relative to the existing literature.\nFor example, the largest Transformer explored in\nVaswani et al. (2017) is (L=6, H=1024, A=16)\nwith 100M parameters for the encoder, and the\nlargest Transformer we have found in the literature\nis (L=64, H=512, A=2) with 235M parameters\n(Al-Rfou et al., 2018). By contrast, BERT BASE\ncontains 110M parameters and BERT LARGE con-\ntains 340M parameters.\nIt has long been known that increasing the\nmodel size will lead to continual improvements\non large-scale tasks such as machine translation\nand language modeling, which is demonstrated\nby the LM perplexity of held-out training data\nshown in Table 6. However, we believe that\nthis is the \ufb01rst work to demonstrate convinc-\ningly that scaling to extreme model sizes also\nleads to large improvements on very small scale\ntasks, provided that the model has been suf\ufb01-\nciently pre-trained.

The LM masking is\napplied after WordPiece tokenization with a uni-\nform masking rate of 15%, and no special consid-\neration given to partial word pieces.\nWe train with batch size of 256 sequences (256\nsequences * 512 tokens = 128,000 tokens/batch)\nfor 1,000,000 steps, which is approximately 40\nepochs over the 3.3 billion word corpus.

Fine-tuning is typically very fast, so it is rea-\nsonable to simply run an exhaustive search over\nthe above parameters and choose the model that\nperforms best on the development set.\nA.4 Comparison of BERT, ELMo ,and\nOpenAI GPT\nHere we studies the differences in recent popular\nrepresentation learning models including ELMo,\nOpenAI GPT and BERT. The comparisons be-\ntween the model architectures are shown visually\nin Figure 3. Note that in addition to the architec-\nture differences, BERT and OpenAI GPT are \ufb01ne-\ntuning approaches, while ELMo is a feature-based\napproach.\nThe most comparable existing pre-training\nmethod to BERT is OpenAI GPT, which trains a\nleft-to-right Transformer LM on a large text cor-\npus. In fact, many of the design decisions in BERT\nwere intentionally made to make it as close to\nGPT as possible so that the two methods could be\nminimally compared. The core argument of this\nwork is that the bi-directionality and the two pre-\ntraining tasks presented in Section 3.1 account for\nthe majority of the empirical improvements, but\nwe do note that there are several other differences\nbetween how BERT and GPT were trained:\n\u2022 GPT is trained on the BooksCorpus (800M\nwords); BERT is trained on the BooksCor-\npus (800M words) and Wikipedia (2,500M\nwords).\n\u2022 GPT uses a sentence separator ( [SEP]) and\nclassi\ufb01er token ( [CLS]) which are only in-\ntroduced at \ufb01ne-tuning time; BERT learns\n[SEP], [CLS] and sentence A/B embed-\ndings during pre-training.\n\u2022 GPT was trained for 1M steps with a batch\nsize of 32,000 words; BERT was trained for\n1M steps with a batch size of 128,000 words.\n\u2022 GPT used the same learning rate of "}

So far, the\nmost striking successes in deep learning have involved discriminative models, usually those that\nmap a high-dimensional, rich sensory input to a class label [14, 22]. These striking successes have\nprimarily been based on the backpropagation and dropout algorithms, using piecewise linear units\n[19, 9, 10] which have a particularly well-behaved gradient .

{"doc_id": "GAN_Paper.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_id": 0, "text": "This framework can yield speci\ufb01c training algorithms for many kinds of model and optimization\nalgorithm. In this article, we explore the special case when the generative model generates samples\nby passing random noise through a multilayer perceptron, and the discriminative model is also a\nmultilayer perceptron. We refer to this special case as adversarial nets. In this case, we can train\nboth models using only the highly successful backpropagation and dropout algorithms [17] and\nsample from the generative model using only forward propagation. No approximate inference or\nMarkov chains are necessary.\n2 Related work\nAn alternative to directed graphical models with latent variables are undirected graphical models\nwith latent variables, such as restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) [27, 16], deep Boltzmann\nmachines (DBMs) [26] and their numerous variants. The interactions within such models are\nrepresented as the product of unnormalized potential functions, normalized by a global summa-\ntion/integration over all states of the random variables. This quantity (the partition function) and\nits gradient are intractable for all but the most trivial instances, although they can be estimated by\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Mixing poses a signi\ufb01cant problem for learning\nalgorithms that rely on MCMC [3, 5].\nDeep belief networks (DBNs) [16] are hybrid models containing a single undirected layer and sev-\neral directed layers. While a fast approximate layer-wise training criterion exists, DBNs incur the\ncomputational dif\ufb01culties associated with both undirected and directed models.\nAlternative criteria that do not approximate or bound the log-likelihood have also been proposed,\nsuch as score matching [18] and noise-contrastive estimation (NCE) [13]. Both of these require the\nlearned probability density to be analytically speci\ufb01ed up to a normalization constant.

However, rather than \ufb01tting a separate discriminative model, the\ngenerative model itself is used to discriminate generated data from samples a \ufb01xed noise distribution.\nBecause NCE uses a \ufb01xed noise distribution, learning slows dramatically after the model has learned\neven an approximately correct distribution over a small subset of the observed variables.\nFinally, some techniques do not involve de\ufb01ning a probability distribution explicitly, but rather train\na generative machine to draw samples from the desired distribution. This approach has the advantage\nthat such machines can be designed to be trained by back-propagation. Prominent recent work in this\narea includes the generative stochastic network (GSN) framework [5], which extends generalized\ndenoising auto-encoders [4]: both can be seen as de\ufb01ning a parameterized Markov chain, i.e., one\nlearns the parameters of a machine that performs one step of a generative Markov chain. Compared\nto GSNs, the adversarial nets framework does not require a Markov chain for sampling. Because\nadversarial nets do not require feedback loops during generation, they are better able to leverage\npiecewise linear units [19, 9, 10], which improve the performance of backpropagation but have\nproblems with unbounded activation when used ina feedback loop. More recent examples of training\na generative machine by back-propagating into it include recent work on auto-encoding variational\nBayes [20] and stochastic backpropagation [24].\n3 Adversarial nets\nThe adversarial modeling framework is most straightforward to apply when the models are both\nmultilayer perceptrons.

See Figure 1 for a less formal, more pedagogical\nexplanation of the approach. In practice, we must implement the game using an iterative, numerical\napproach. Optimizing Dto completion in the inner loop of training is computationally prohibitive,\nand on \ufb01nite datasets would result in over\ufb01tting. Instead, we alternate betweenksteps of optimizing\nD and one step of optimizing G. This results in D being maintained near its optimal solution, so\nlong as Gchanges slowly enough. This strategy is analogous to the way that SML/PCD [31, 29]\ntraining maintains samples from a Markov chain from one learning step to the next in order to avoid\nburning in a Markov chain as part of the inner loop of learning. The procedure is formally presented\nin Algorithm 1.\nIn practice, equation 1 may not provide suf\ufb01cient gradient for Gto learn well.

Consider V(G,D) = U(pg,D) as a function of pg as done in the above criterion. Note\nthat U(pg,D) is convex in pg. The subderivatives of a supremum of convex functions include the\nderivative of the function at the point where the maximum is attained. In other words, if f(x) =\nsup\u03b1\u2208Af\u03b1(x) and f\u03b1(x) is convex in xfor every \u03b1, then \u2202f\u03b2(x) \u2208\u2202f if \u03b2 = arg sup\u03b1\u2208Af\u03b1(x).\nThis is equivalent to computing a gradient descent update for pg at the optimal D given the cor-\nresponding G. supDU(pg,D) is convex in pg with a unique global optima as proven in Thm 1,\ntherefore with suf\ufb01ciently small updates of pg, pg converges to px, concluding the proof.\nIn practice, adversarial nets represent a limited family of pg distributions via the function G(z; \u03b8g),\nand we optimize \u03b8g rather than pg itself. Using a multilayer perceptron to de\ufb01ne G introduces\nmultiple critical points in parameter space.

The advantages are that Markov\nchains are never needed, only backprop is used to obtain gradients, no inference is needed during\nlearning, and a wide variety of functions can be incorporated into the model. Table 2 summarizes\nthe comparison of generative adversarial nets with other generative modeling approaches.\nThe aforementioned advantages are primarily computational. Adversarial models may also gain\nsome statistical advantage from the generator network not being updated directly with data exam-\nples, but only with gradients \ufb02owing through the discriminator. This means that components of the\ninput are not copied directly into the generator\u2019s parameters. Another advantage of adversarial net-\nworks is that they can represent very sharp, even degenerate distributions, while methods based on\nMarkov chains require that the distribution be somewhat blurry in order for the chains to be able to\nmix between modes.\n7 Conclusions and future work\nThis framework admits many straightforward extensions:\n1. A conditional generative model p(x |c) can be obtained by adding c as input to both Gand D.\n2. Learned approximate inference can be performed by training an auxiliary network to predict z\ngiven x. This is similar to the inference net trained by the wake-sleep algorithm [15] but with\nthe advantage that the inference net may be trained for a \ufb01xed generator net after the generator\nnet has \ufb01nished training.\n7"}

On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5%\nand 17.0% which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The\nneural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists\nof \ufb01ve convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers,\nand three fully-connected layers with a \ufb01nal 1000-way softmax. To make train-\ning faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very ef\ufb01cient GPU implemen-\ntation of the convolution operation. To reduce over\ufb01tting in the fully-connected\nlayers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called \u201cdropout\u201d\nthat proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the\nILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%,\ncompared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry.\n1 Introduction\nCurrent approaches to object recognition make essential use of machine learning methods. To im-\nprove their performance, we can collect larger datasets, learn more powerful models, and use bet-\nter techniques for preventing over\ufb01tting. Until recently, datasets of labeled images were relatively\nsmall \u2014 on the order of tens of thousands of images (e.g., NORB [16], Caltech-101/256 [8, 9], and\nCIFAR-10/100 [12]).

For example, the current-\nbest error rate on the MNIST digit-recognition task (<0.3%) approaches human performance [4].\nBut objects in realistic settings exhibit considerable variability, so to learn to recognize them it is\nnecessary to use much larger training sets. And indeed, the shortcomings of small image datasets\nhave been widely recognized (e.g., Pinto et al. [21]), but it has only recently become possible to col-\nlect labeled datasets with millions of images. The new larger datasets include LabelMe [23], which\nconsists of hundreds of thousands of fully-segmented images, and ImageNet [6], which consists of\nover 15 million labeled high-resolution images in over 22,000 categories.\nTo learn about thousands of objects from millions of images, we need a model with a large learning\ncapacity. However, the immense complexity of the object recognition task means that this prob-\nlem cannot be speci\ufb01ed even by a dataset as large as ImageNet, so our model should also have lots\nof prior knowledge to compensate for all the data we don\u2019t have. Convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) constitute one such class of models [16, 11, 13, 18, 15, 22, 26]. Their capacity can be con-\ntrolled by varying their depth and breadth, and they also make strong and mostly correct assumptions\nabout the nature of images (namely, stationarity of statistics and locality of pixel dependencies).\nThus, compared to standard feedforward neural networks with similarly-sized layers, CNNs have\nmuch fewer connections and parameters and so they are easier to train, while their theoretically-best\nperformance is likely to be only slightly worse.\n1"}

The images were collected from the web and labeled by human labelers using Ama-\nzon\u2019s Mechanical Turk crowd-sourcing tool. Starting in 2010, as part of the Pascal Visual Object\nChallenge, an annual competition called the ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge\n(ILSVRC) has been held. ILSVRC uses a subset of ImageNet with roughly 1000 images in each of\n1000 categories. In all, there are roughly 1.2 million training images, 50,000 validation images, and\n150,000 testing images.\nILSVRC-2010 is the only version of ILSVRC for which the test set labels are available, so this is\nthe version on which we performed most of our experiments. Since we also entered our model in\nthe ILSVRC-2012 competition, in Section 6 we report our results on this version of the dataset as\nwell, for which test set labels are unavailable. On ImageNet, it is customary to report two error rates:\ntop-1 and top-5, where the top-5 error rate is the fraction of test images for which the correct label\nis not among the \ufb01ve labels considered most probable by the model.\nImageNet consists of variable-resolution images, while our system requires a constant input dimen-\nsionality. Therefore, we down-sampled the images to a \ufb01xed resolution of 256 \u00d7256. Given a\nrectangular image, we \ufb01rst rescaled the image such that the shorter side was of length 256, and then\ncropped out the central256\u00d7256 patch from the resulting image. We did not pre-process the images\nin any other way, except for subtracting the mean activity over the training set from each pixel.

The learning rates for each net-\nwork were chosen independently to make train-\ning as fast as possible. No regularization of\nany kind was employed. The magnitude of the\neffect demonstrated here varies with network\narchitecture, but networks with ReLUs consis-\ntently learn several times faster than equivalents\nwith saturating neurons.\nThe standard way to model a neuron\u2019s output f as\na function of its input x is with f(x) = tanh( x)\nor f(x) = (1 +e\u2212x)\u22121. In terms of training time\nwith gradient descent, these saturating nonlinearities\nare much slower than the non-saturating nonlinearity\nf(x) = max(0,x). Following Nair and Hinton [20],\nwe refer to neurons with this nonlinearity as Recti\ufb01ed\nLinear Units (ReLUs). Deep convolutional neural net-\nworks with ReLUs train several times faster than their\nequivalents with tanh units. This is demonstrated in\nFigure 1, which shows the number of iterations re-\nquired to reach 25% training error on the CIFAR-10\ndataset for a particular four-layer convolutional net-\nwork. This plot shows that we would not have been\nable to experiment with such large neural networks for\nthis work if we had used traditional saturating neuron\nmodels.\nWe are not the \ufb01rst to consider alternatives to tradi-\ntional neuron models in CNNs.

It turns out that 1.2 million training examples are enough to train networks\nwhich are too big to \ufb01t on one GPU. Therefore we spread the net across two GPUs. Current GPUs\nare particularly well-suited to cross-GPU parallelization, as they are able to read from and write to\none another\u2019s memory directly, without going through host machine memory. The parallelization\nscheme that we employ essentially puts half of the kernels (or neurons) on each GPU, with one\nadditional trick: the GPUs communicate only in certain layers. This means that, for example, the\nkernels of layer 3 take input from all kernel maps in layer 2. However, kernels in layer 4 take input\nonly from those kernel maps in layer 3 which reside on the same GPU. Choosing the pattern of\nconnectivity is a problem for cross-validation, but this allows us to precisely tune the amount of\ncommunication until it is an acceptable fraction of the amount of computation.\nThe resultant architecture is somewhat similar to that of the \u201ccolumnar\u201d CNN employed by Cire\u00b8 san\net al. [5], except that our columns are not independent (see Figure 2). This scheme reduces our top-1\nand top-5 error rates by 1.7% and 1.2%, respectively, as compared with a net with half as many\nkernels in each convolutional layer trained on one GPU. The two-GPU net takes slightly less time\nto train than the one-GPU net2.\n2The one-GPU net actually has the same number of kernels as the two-GPU net in the \ufb01nal convolutional\nlayer.

If at least some training examples produce a positive input to a ReLU, learning will\nhappen in that neuron. However, we still \ufb01nd that the following local normalization scheme aids\ngeneralization. Denoting by ai\nx,y the activity of a neuron computed by applying kernel iat position\n(x,y) and then applying the ReLU nonlinearity, the response-normalized activity bi\nx,y is given by\nthe expression\nbi\nx,y = ai\nx,y/\n\uf8eb\n\uf8edk+ \u03b1\nmin(N\u22121,i+n/2)\u2211\nj=max(0,i\u2212n/2)\n(aj\nx,y)2\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\u03b2\nwhere the sum runs over n\u201cadjacent\u201d kernel maps at the same spatial position, and N is the total\nnumber of kernels in the layer. The ordering of the kernel maps is of course arbitrary and determined\nbefore training begins. This sort of response normalization implements a form of lateral inhibition\ninspired by the type found in real neurons, creating competition for big activities amongst neuron\noutputs computed using different kernels. The constants k,n,\u03b1 , and \u03b2are hyper-parameters whose\nvalues are determined using a validation set; we used k = 2, n= 5, \u03b1= 10\u22124, and \u03b2 = 0.75. We\napplied this normalization after applying the ReLU nonlinearity in certain layers (see Section 3.5).\nThis scheme bears some resemblance to the local contrast normalization scheme of Jarrett et al. [11],\nbut ours would be more correctly termed \u201cbrightness normalization\u201d, since we do not subtract the\nmean activity. Response normalization reduces our top-1 and top-5 error rates by 1.4% and 1.2%,\nrespectively.

Traditionally, the neighborhoods summarized by adjacent pooling units do not overlap (e.g.,\n[17, 11, 4]). To be more precise, a pooling layer can be thought of as consisting of a grid of pooling\nunits spaced spixels apart, each summarizing a neighborhood of size z\u00d7zcentered at the location\nof the pooling unit. If we set s = z, we obtain traditional local pooling as commonly employed\nin CNNs. If we set s < z, we obtain overlapping pooling. This is what we use throughout our\nnetwork, with s = 2and z = 3. This scheme reduces the top-1 and top-5 error rates by 0.4% and\n0.3%, respectively, as compared with the non-overlapping scheme s = 2,z = 2, which produces\noutput of equivalent dimensions. We generally observe during training that models with overlapping\npooling \ufb01nd it slightly more dif\ufb01cult to over\ufb01t.\n3.5 Overall Architecture\nNow we are ready to describe the overall architecture of our CNN. As depicted in Figure 2, the net\ncontains eight layers with weights; the \ufb01rst \ufb01ve are convolutional and the remaining three are fully-\nconnected. The output of the last fully-connected layer is fed to a 1000-way softmax which produces\na distribution over the 1000 class labels. Our network maximizes the multinomial logistic regression\nobjective, which is equivalent to maximizing the average across training cases of the log-probability\nof the correct label under the prediction distribution.\nThe kernels of the second, fourth, and \ufb01fth convolutional layers are connected only to those kernel\nmaps in the previous layer which reside on the same GPU (see Figure 2).

Although the 1000 classes of ILSVRC\nmake each training example impose 10 bits of constraint on the mapping from image to label, this\nturns out to be insuf\ufb01cient to learn so many parameters without considerable over\ufb01tting. Below, we\ndescribe the two primary ways in which we combat over\ufb01tting.\n4.1 Data Augmentation\nThe easiest and most common method to reduce over\ufb01tting on image data is to arti\ufb01cially enlarge\nthe dataset using label-preserving transformations (e.g., [25, 4, 5]). We employ two distinct forms\nof data augmentation, both of which allow transformed images to be produced from the original\nimages with very little computation, so the transformed images do not need to be stored on disk.\nIn our implementation, the transformed images are generated in Python code on the CPU while the\nGPU is training on the previous batch"}

So these data augmentation schemes are, in effect,\ncomputationally free.\nThe \ufb01rst form of data augmentation consists of generating image translations and horizontal re\ufb02ec-\ntions. We do this by extracting random224 \u00d7224 patches (and their horizontal re\ufb02ections) from the\n256\u00d7256 images and training our network on these extracted patches4. This increases the size of our\ntraining set by a factor of 2048, though the resulting training examples are, of course, highly inter-\ndependent. Without this scheme, our network suffers from substantial over\ufb01tting, which would have\nforced us to use much smaller networks. At test time, the network makes a prediction by extracting\n\ufb01ve 224 \u00d7224 patches (the four corner patches and the center patch) as well as their horizontal\nre\ufb02ections (hence ten patches in all), and averaging the predictions made by the network\u2019s softmax\nlayer on the ten patches.\nThe second form of data augmentation consists of altering the intensities of the RGB channels in\ntraining images. Speci\ufb01cally, we perform PCA on the set of RGB pixel values throughout the\nImageNet training set. To each training image, we add multiples of the found principal components,\n4This is the reason why the input images in Figure 2 are 224 \u00d7 224 \u00d7 3-dimensional.\n5"}

Each \u03b1i is drawn only once\nfor all the pixels of a particular training image until that image is used for training again, at which\npoint it is re-drawn. This scheme approximately captures an important property of natural images,\nnamely, that object identity is invariant to changes in the intensity and color of the illumination. This\nscheme reduces the top-1 error rate by over 1%.\n4.2 Dropout\nCombining the predictions of many different models is a very successful way to reduce test errors\n[1, 3], but it appears to be too expensive for big neural networks that already take several days\nto train. There is, however, a very ef\ufb01cient version of model combination that only costs about a\nfactor of two during training. The recently-introduced technique, called \u201cdropout\u201d [10], consists\nof setting to zero the output of each hidden neuron with probability 0.5. The neurons which are\n\u201cdropped out\u201d in this way do not contribute to the forward pass and do not participate in back-\npropagation. So every time an input is presented, the neural network samples a different architecture,\nbut all these architectures share weights. This technique reduces complex co-adaptations of neurons,\nsince a neuron cannot rely on the presence of particular other neurons. It is, therefore, forced to\nlearn more robust features that are useful in conjunction with many different random subsets of the\nother neurons.

The\nremaining columns show the six training images that produce feature vectors in the last hidden layer with the\nsmallest Euclidean distance from the feature vector for the test image.\nIn the left panel of Figure 4 we qualitatively assess what the network has learned by computing its\ntop-5 predictions on eight test images. Notice that even off-center objects, such as the mite in the\ntop-left, can be recognized by the net. Most of the top-5 labels appear reasonable. For example,\nonly other types of cat are considered plausible labels for the leopard. In some cases (grille, cherry)\nthere is genuine ambiguity about the intended focus of the photograph.\nAnother way to probe the network\u2019s visual knowledge is to consider the feature activations induced\nby an image at the last, 4096-dimensional hidden layer. If two images produce feature activation\nvectors with a small Euclidean separation, we can say that the higher levels of the neural network\nconsider them to be similar. Figure 4 shows \ufb01ve images from the test set and the six images from\nthe training set that are most similar to each of them according to this measure.

It is notable\nthat our network\u2019s performance degrades if a single convolutional layer is removed. For example,\nremoving any of the middle layers results in a loss of about 2% for the top-1 performance of the\nnetwork. So the depth really is important for achieving our results.\nTo simplify our experiments, we did not use any unsupervised pre-training even though we expect\nthat it will help, especially if we obtain enough computational power to signi\ufb01cantly increase the\nsize of the network without obtaining a corresponding increase in the amount of labeled data. Thus\nfar, our results have improved as we have made our network larger and trained it longer but we still\nhave many orders of magnitude to go in order to match the infero-temporal pathway of the human\nvisual system. Ultimately we would like to use very large and deep convolutional nets on video\nsequences where the temporal structure provides very helpful information that is missing or far less\nobvious in static images.\n8"}

In-\nstead of hoping each few stacked layers directly \ufb01t a\ndesired underlying mapping, we explicitly let these lay-\ners \ufb01t a residual mapping. Formally, denoting the desired\nunderlying mapping as H(x), we let the stacked nonlinear\nlayers \ufb01t another mapping of F(x) :=H(x) \u2212x. The orig-\ninal mapping is recast intoF(x)+ x.

To the extreme, if an\nidentity mapping were optimal, it would be easier to push\nthe residual to zero than to \ufb01t an identity mapping by a stack\nof nonlinear layers.\nThe formulation of F(x) +x can be realized by feedfor-\nward neural networks with \u201cshortcut connections\u201d (Fig. 2).\nShortcut connections [2, 34, 49] are those skipping one or\nmore layers. In our case, the shortcut connections simply\nperform identity mapping, and their outputs are added to\nthe outputs of the stacked layers (Fig. 2). Identity short-\ncut connections add neither extra parameter nor computa-\ntional complexity.

An alternative to Multigrid is hierarchical basis pre-\nconditioning [45, 46], which relies on variables that repre-\nsent residual vectors between two scales. It has been shown\n[3, 45, 46] that these solvers converge much faster than stan-\ndard solvers that are unaware of the residual nature of the\nsolutions. These methods suggest that a good reformulation\nor preconditioning can simplify the optimization.\nShortcut Connections. Practices and theories that lead to\nshortcut connections [2, 34, 49] have been studied for a long\ntime. An early practice of training multi-layer perceptrons\n(MLPs) is to add a linear layer connected from the network\ninput to the output [34, 49]. In [44, 24], a few interme-\ndiate layers are directly connected to auxiliary classi\ufb01ers\nfor addressing vanishing/exploding gradients. The papers\nof [39, 38, 31, 47] propose methods for centering layer re-\nsponses, gradients, and propagated errors, implemented by\nshortcut connections.

Deep Residual Learning\n3.1. Residual Learning\nLet us consider H(x) as an underlying mapping to be\n\ufb01t by a few stacked layers (not necessarily the entire net),\nwith x denoting the inputs to the \ufb01rst of these layers. If one\nhypothesizes that multiple nonlinear layers can asymptoti-\ncally approximate complicated functions2, then it is equiv-\nalent to hypothesize that they can asymptotically approxi-\nmate the residual functions, i.e., H(x) \u2212x (assuming that\nthe input and output are of the same dimensions). So\nrather than expect stacked layers to approximate H(x), we\nexplicitly let these layers approximate a residual function\nF(x) := H(x) \u2212x. The original function thus becomes\nF(x)+ x. Although both forms should be able to asymptot-\nically approximate the desired functions (as hypothesized),\nthe ease of learning might be different.\nThis reformulation is motivated by the counterintuitive\nphenomena about the degradation problem (Fig. 1, left). As\nwe discussed in the introduction, if the added layers can\nbe constructed as identity mappings, a deeper model should\nhave training error no greater than its shallower counter-\npart. The degradation problem suggests that the solvers\nmight have dif\ufb01culties in approximating identity mappings\nby multiple nonlinear layers. With the residual learning re-\nformulation, if identity mappings are optimal, the solvers\nmay simply drive the weights of the multiple nonlinear lay-\ners toward zero to approach identity mappings.\nIn real cases, it is unlikely that identity mappings are op-\ntimal, but our reformulation may help to precondition the\nproblem. If the optimal function is closer to an identity\nmapping than to a zero mapping, it should be easier for the\nsolver to \ufb01nd the perturbations with reference to an identity\nmapping, than to learn the function as a new one. We show\nby experiments (Fig. 7) that the learned residual functions in\ngeneral have small responses, suggesting that identity map-\npings provide reasonable preconditioning.\n3.2.

The function F(x,{Wi}) can repre-\nsent multiple convolutional layers. The element-wise addi-\ntion is performed on two feature maps, channel by channel.\n3.3. Network Architectures\nWe have tested various plain/residual nets, and have ob-\nserved consistent phenomena. To provide instances for dis-\ncussion, we describe two models for ImageNet as follows.\nPlain Network. Our plain baselines (Fig. 3, middle) are\nmainly inspired by the philosophy of VGG nets [41] (Fig. 3,\nleft). The convolutional layers mostly have 3 \u00d73 \ufb01lters and\nfollow two simple design rules: (i) for the same output\nfeature map size, the layers have the same number of \ufb01l-\nters; and (ii) if the feature map size is halved, the num-\nber of \ufb01lters is doubled so as to preserve the time com-\nplexity per layer. We perform downsampling directly by\nconvolutional layers that have a stride of 2. The network\nends with a global average pooling layer and a 1000-way\nfully-connected layer with softmax. The total number of\nweighted layers is 34 in Fig. 3 (middle).\nIt is worth noticing that our model has fewer \ufb01lters and\nlower complexity than VGG nets [41] (Fig. 3, left). Our 34-\nlayer baseline has 3.6 billion FLOPs (multiply-adds), which\nis only 18% of VGG-19 (19.6 billion"}

Based on the above plain network, we\ninsert shortcut connections (Fig. 3, right) which turn the\nnetwork into its counterpart residual version. The identity\nshortcuts (Eqn.(1)) can be directly used when the input and\noutput are of the same dimensions (solid line shortcuts in\nFig. 3). When the dimensions increase (dotted line shortcuts\nin Fig. 3), we consider two options: (A) The shortcut still\nperforms identity mapping, with extra zero entries padded\nfor increasing dimensions. This option introduces no extra\nparameter; (B) The projection shortcut in Eqn.(2) is used to\nmatch dimensions (done by 1 \u00d71 convolutions). For both\noptions, when the shortcuts go across feature maps of two\nsizes, they are performed with a stride of 2.\n3.4. Implementation\nOur implementation for ImageNet follows the practice\nin [21, 41]. The image is resized with its shorter side ran-\ndomly sampled in [256,480] for scale augmentation [41].\nA 224\u00d7224 crop is randomly sampled from an image or its\nhorizontal \ufb02ip, with the per-pixel mean subtracted [21]. The\nstandard color augmentation in [21] is used. We adopt batch\nnormalization (BN) [16] right after each convolution and\nbefore activation, following [16]. We initialize the weights\nas in [13] and train all plain/residual nets from scratch. We\nuse SGD with a mini-batch size of 256. The learning rate\nstarts from 0.1 and is divided by 10 when the error plateaus,\nand the models are trained for up to60 \u00d7104 iterations. We\nuse a weight decay of 0.0001 and a momentum of 0.9.

This comparison veri\ufb01es the effectiveness of residual\nlearning on extremely deep systems.\nLast, we also note that the 18-layer plain/residual nets\nare comparably accurate (Table 2), but the 18-layer ResNet\nconverges faster (Fig. 4 right vs. left). When the net is \u201cnot\noverly deep\u201d (18 layers here), the current SGD solver is still\nable to \ufb01nd good solutions to the plain net. In this case, the\nResNet eases the optimization by providing faster conver-\ngence at the early stage.\nIdentity vs. Projection Shortcuts.

But the small dif-\nferences among A/B/C indicate that projection shortcuts are\nnot essential for addressing the degradation problem. So we\ndo not use option C in the rest of this paper, to reduce mem-\nory/time complexity and model sizes. Identity shortcuts are\nparticularly important for not increasing the complexity of\nthe bottleneck architectures that are introduced below.\nDeeper Bottleneck Architectures. Next we describe our\ndeeper nets for ImageNet. Because of concerns on the train-\ning time that we can afford, we modify the building block\nas a bottleneck design4. For each residual function F, we\nuse a stack of 3 layers instead of 2 (Fig. 5). The three layers\nare 1\u00d71, 3\u00d73, and 1\u00d71 convolutions, where the 1\u00d71 layers\nare responsible for reducing and then increasing (restoring)\ndimensions, leaving the 3\u00d73 layer a bottleneck with smaller\ninput/output dimensions. Fig. 5 shows an example, where\nboth designs have similar time complexity.\nThe parameter-free identity shortcuts are particularly im-\nportant for the bottleneck architectures. If the identity short-\ncut in Fig. 5 (right) is replaced with projection, one can\nshow that the time complexity and model size are doubled,\nas the shortcut is connected to the two high-dimensional\nends.

{"doc_id": "ResNet_PAPER.pdf", "page": 10, "chunk_id": 0, "text": "A. Object Detection Baselines\nIn this section we introduce our detection method based\non the baseline Faster R-CNN [32] system. The models are\ninitialized by the ImageNet classi\ufb01cation models, and then\n\ufb01ne-tuned on the object detection data. We have experi-\nmented with ResNet-50/101 at the time of the ILSVRC &\nCOCO 2015 detection competitions.\nUnlike VGG-16 used in [32], our ResNet has no hidden\nfc layers. We adopt the idea of \u201cNetworks on Conv fea-\nture maps\u201d (NoC) [33] to address this issue. We compute\nthe full-image shared conv feature maps using those lay-\ners whose strides on the image are no greater than 16 pixels\n(i.e., conv1, conv2 x, conv3 x, and conv4 x, totally 91 conv\nlayers in ResNet-101; Table 1). We consider these layers as\nanalogous to the 13 conv layers in VGG-16, and by doing\nso, both ResNet and VGG-16 have conv feature maps of the\nsame total stride (16 pixels). These layers are shared by a\nregion proposal network (RPN, generating 300 proposals)\n[32] and a Fast R-CNN detection network [7]. RoI pool-\ning [7] is performed before conv5 1. On this RoI-pooled\nfeature, all layers of conv5 x and up are adopted for each\nregion, playing the roles of VGG-16\u2019s fc layers. The \ufb01nal\nclassi\ufb01cation layer is replaced by two sibling layers (classi-\n\ufb01cation and box regression [7]).\nFor the usage of BN layers, after pre-training, we com-\npute the BN statistics (means and variances) for each layer\non the ImageNet training set. Then the BN layers are \ufb01xed\nduring \ufb01ne-tuning for object detection. As such, the BN\nlayers become linear activations with constant offsets and\nscales, and BN statistics are not updated by \ufb01ne-tuning. We\n\ufb01x the BN layers mainly for reducing memory consumption\nin Faster R-CNN training.\nPASCAL VOC\nFollowing [7, 32], for the PASCAL VOC 2007 test set,\nwe use the 5"}

We\n\ufb01x the BN layers mainly for reducing memory consumption\nin Faster R-CNN training.\nPASCAL VOC\nFollowing [7, 32], for the PASCAL VOC 2007 test set,\nwe use the 5k trainval images in VOC 2007 and 16k train-\nval images in VOC 2012 for training (\u201c07+12\u201d). For the\nPASCAL VOC 2012 test set, we use the 10k trainval+test\nimages in VOC 2007 and 16ktrainval images in VOC 2012\nfor training (\u201c07++12\u201d). The hyper-parameters for train-\ning Faster R-CNN are the same as in [32]. Table 7 shows\nthe results. ResNet-101 improves the mAP by >3% over\nVGG-16. This gain is solely because of the improved fea-\ntures learned by ResNet.\nMS COCO\nThe MS COCO dataset [26] involves 80 object cate-\ngories. We evaluate the PASCAL VOC metric (mAP @\nIoU = 0.5) and the standard COCO metric (mAP @ IoU =\n.5:.05:.95). We use the 80k images on the train set for train-\ning and the 40k images on the val set for evaluation. Our\ndetection system for COCO is similar to that for PASCAL\nVOC. We train the COCO models with an 8-GPU imple-\nmentation, and thus the RPN step has a mini-batch size of\n8 images (i.e., 1 per GPU) and the Fast R-CNN step has a\nmini-batch size of 16 images. The RPN step and Fast R-\nCNN step are both trained for 240k iterations with a learn-\ning rate of 0.001 and then for 80k iterations with 0.0001.\nTable 8 shows the results on the MS COCO validation\nset.

ResNet-101 has a 6% increase of mAP@[.5, .95] over\nVGG-16, which is a 28% relative improvement, solely con-\ntributed by the features learned by the better network. Re-\nmarkably, the mAP@[.5, .95]\u2019s absolute increase (6.0%) is\nnearly as big as mAP@.5\u2019s (6.9%). This suggests that a\ndeeper network can improve both recognition and localiza-\ntion.\nB. Object Detection Improvements\nFor completeness, we report the improvements made for\nthe competitions. These improvements are based on deep\nfeatures and thus should bene\ufb01t from residual learning.\nMS COCO\nBox re\ufb01nement. Our box re\ufb01nement partially follows the it-\nerative localization in [6]. In Faster R-CNN, the \ufb01nal output\nis a regressed box that is different from its proposal box. So\nfor inference, we pool a new feature from the regressed box\nand obtain a new classi\ufb01cation score and a new regressed\nbox. We combine these 300 new predictions with the orig-\ninal 300 predictions. Non-maximum suppression (NMS) is\napplied on the union set of predicted boxes using an IoU\nthreshold of 0.3 [8], followed by box voting [6]. Box re-\n\ufb01nement improves mAP by about 2 points (Table 9).\nGlobal context. We combine global context in the Fast\nR-CNN step. Given the full-image conv feature map, we\npool a feature by global Spatial Pyramid Pooling [12] (with\na \u201csingle-level\u201d pyramid) which can be implemented as\n\u201cRoI\u201d pooling using the entire image\u2019s bounding box as the\nRoI. This pooled feature is fed into the post-RoI layers to\nobtain a global context feature.

Global context im-\nproves mAP@.5 by about 1 point (Table 9).\nMulti-scale testing. In the above, all results are obtained by\nsingle-scale training/testing as in [32], where the image\u2019s\nshorter side is s = 600pixels. Multi-scale training/testing\nhas been developed in [12, 7] by selecting a scale from a\nfeature pyramid, and in [33] by using maxout layers. In\nour current implementation, we have performed multi-scale\ntesting following [33]; we have not performed multi-scale\ntraining because of limited time. In addition, we have per-\nformed multi-scale testing only for the Fast R-CNN step\n(but not yet for the RPN step). With a trained model, we\ncompute conv feature maps on an image pyramid, where the\nimage\u2019s shorter sides are s \u2208 {200,400,600,800,1000}.\n10"}

But we notice that on this dataset, one image usually\ncontains a single dominate object, and the proposal regions\nhighly overlap with each other and thus have very similar\nRoI-pooled features. As a result, the image-centric training\nof Fast R-CNN [7] generates samples of small variations,\nwhich may not be desired for stochastic training. Motivated\nby this, in our current experiment we use the original R-\nCNN [8] that is RoI-centric, in place of Fast R-CNN.\nOur R-CNN implementation is as follows. We apply the\nper-class RPN trained as above on the training images to\npredict bounding boxes for the ground truth class. These\npredicted boxes play a role of class-dependent proposals.\nFor each training image, the highest scored 200 proposals\nare extracted as training samples to train an R-CNN classi-\n\ufb01er.

The outputs of this network consist of two\nsibling fc layers for cls and reg, also in a per-class form.\nThis R-CNN network is \ufb01ne-tuned on the training set us-\ning a mini-batch size of 256 in the RoI-centric fashion. For\ntesting, the RPN generates the highest scored 200 proposals\nfor each predicted class, and the R-CNN network is used to\nupdate these proposals\u2019 scores and box positions.\nThis method reduces the top-5 localization error to\n10.6% (Table 13). This is our single-model result on the\nvalidation set. Using an ensemble of networks for both clas-\nsi\ufb01cation and localization, we achieve a top-5 localization\nerror of 9.0% on the test set. This number signi\ufb01cantly out-\nperforms the ILSVRC 14 results (Table 14), showing a 64%\nrelative reduction of error. This result won the 1st place in\nthe ImageNet localization task in ILSVRC 2015.\n12"}
